## About

I am a mathematics student working at the intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence, focused on structured problem solving and clear reasoning.  
Currently studying at a state-level selective high school with a curriculum emphasizing advanced mathematics.

### Current Focus

- Mathematics Olympiad: Systematic training in combinatorics, number theory, and Euclidean geometry.  
- AI Olympiad: Applying algorithmic and ML techniques to competitive problem-solving tasks.  
- Machine Learning: Building practical computer vision models and interactive AI systems.

![Frontend](https://img.shields.io/badge/Frontend-FF6B6B?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

An educational AI chatbot designed to support guided learning and problem solving.  
Developed in collaboration with [moein](https://github.com/Moein-007)

- Educational design: layered hints and guiding questions instead of direct answers.  
- Technical approach: structured interaction framework and NLP components to ensure clarity and pedagogical value.  
- Frontend: minimal, responsive UI focused on student–AI interaction.

## Technical Capabilities

- Machine Learning & Computer Vision: model development and deployment for text and image tasks (PyTorch, OpenCV).  
- Product Development: end-to-end AI product design — from mathematical modeling to frontend delivery.  
- Frontend: building lightweight interactive interfaces for AI systems.  
- Mathematics: rigorous problem solving, proof-style thinking, structural analysis.
